## Introduction

The CapstoneConnect Web App is a platform designed to facilitate regular connections between mentors and mentees. It is a tool for mentors to track their mentees' progress on Capstone and provide reviews. The app will be made using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and will have features that allow you to update your daily progress and get Green, Yellow, and Red badges based on your regular updates on your capstone and get feedback from your mentor in a particular assignment.
